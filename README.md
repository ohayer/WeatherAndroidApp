# My First Andorid App 
This application utilizes the API from https://openweathermap.org/ to retrieve current weather properties, allowing users to search for cities with specific weather conditions. It displays basic weather information such as wind speed in kilometers per hour, temperature, sunrise and sunset times, today's date, and atmospheric pressure.

In the event of an invalid city name entry, a toast notification will be displayed, indicating that the city does not exist. Additionally, the application has been designed with an aesthetically pleasing user interface in mind.
